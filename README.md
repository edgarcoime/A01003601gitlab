```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

An MD file is a text file created using many dialects of the Markdown language. 
It is very flexible because it includes inline text symbols that define
how to format the text (e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting.)

This is very useful because it allows Code and Syntax highlighting like the examples below
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s)
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

This allows github or any version control to compare files to their historical revisions
in human-readable text.
